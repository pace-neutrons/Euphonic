Scattering Intensities
======================

Scattering intensities in Euphonic are represented as generic
:ref:`Spectrum2D` objects.

Currently Euphonic only supports calculating one-phonon coherent
scattering intensities. See :ref:`here <scattering-intensities-from-sf>`
for how to calculate scattering intensities along a specific
crystal q-direction. Euphonic can also calculate powder-averaged
scattering intensities at particular |q| using the command-line tool
:ref:`euphonic-powder-map <powder-map-script>` or with the :ref:`powder`
module.
