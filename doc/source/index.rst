Euphonic
********

Euphonic is a Python package that can efficiently calculate phonon
bandstructures and inelastic neutron scattering intensities from a force
constants matrix (e.g. from a .castep_bin file). Euphonic can also do
simple plotting, and can plot dispersion and density of states from
precalculated phonon frequencies (e.g. CASTEP .phonon files).

The main way to interact with Euphonic is via the Python API, but there are
also some useful command line tools. See the links below for more
information.
