Tutorials
=========

The main way to interact with Euphonic is via the Python API, but there are
also some useful helper scripts. See the links below for more information on
how to read, interpolate and plot phonon frequencies, density of states and
inelastic neutron scattering intensities.

Note: There has been a major refactor since v0.2.2. The tutorials have been
updated but see :ref:`here <refactor>` for a summary of the changes.
