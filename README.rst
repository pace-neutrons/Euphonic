Euphonic
========

Euphonic is a Python package that can efficiently calculate phonon
bandstructures and inelastic neutron scattering intensities from a force
constants matrix (e.g. from a .castep_bin file). Euphonic can also do
simple plotting, and can plot dispersion and density of states from
precalculated phonon frequencies (e.g. CASTEP .bands or .phonon).
