# Most euphonic tests/builds use Clang, but users might have GCC.
# New GCC versions often promote bad practices from warnings to errors,
# so a GCC update can unexpectedly break things.
# It would be neat to somehow ensure automatically that we are using a
# very recent GCC. Otherwise, this workflow will need updating occasionally.
